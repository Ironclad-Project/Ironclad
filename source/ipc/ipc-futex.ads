package IPC.Futex is
   --  This module implements fast userland mutexes, despite the userland tag,
   --  they are perfectly usable inside kernel mode as well.
   --
   --  These futexes work by watching a memory address for an expected value,
   --  with some timeout limits. Once the expected value is found, the thread
   --  will wait for explicit wakeup.

   --  Information to depict an element to wait on.
   type Element is record
      Key_Addr : System.Address;
      Expected : Unsigned_32;
   end record;
   type Element_Arr is array (Natural range <>) of Element;

   type Wait_Status is (Wait_Success, Wait_No_Space, Wait_Try_Again);

   --  Wait for a set of keys.
   --  @param Map  Map to use to check keys.
   --  @param Keys Keys to wait for.
   --  @param Max_Seconds Maximum amount of seconds to wait for.
   --  @param Max_Nanos   Nanoseconds component of Max_Seconds.
   --  @param Success     Status on the wait.
