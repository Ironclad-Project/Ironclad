--  FIXME: Sometimes GNAT will give warnings of the style:
--     pragma Restrictions (No_Exception_Propagation) in effect [-gnatw.x]
--     this handler can never be entered, and has been removed [-gnatw.x]
--  But when these handlers are removed, GNAT asks for them again.
--  I am not sure whether this is a compiler bug or me not understanding
--  something, but in the meantime, we will silence these warnings.
